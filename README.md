# Crash-Modeling
The goal of this project is to build a crash prediction model that identifies and explains the contributing factors of risk, and accident severity in order to be used to assess the impact of intervention for car accidents. 
Car accidents are still one of the biggest causes of death in the world. For that reason, the development of models for an efficient and accurate prediction of traffic accident location and severity, is necessary. This project analyzes circumstances of road accidents in the UK in 2017. The statistics relate only to personal injury accidents on public roads that are reported to the police, and subsequently recorded, using the STATS19 accident reporting form. This project is intended for City transportation departments and those responsible for managing risk on road networks. 
I am replicating and adapting a proposed a methodology (Tambouratzis & Souliou & Chalikias, 2014) that involves feature selection of the accident parameters that maximize prediction accuracy (implemented through Random Forest search), followed by feature extraction through principal component analysis and selection of minimal components that contain relevant information of the original parameters. Finally, I applied accident severity prediction through random forests, and I compared with existing accident classification/prediction approaches in the field.
